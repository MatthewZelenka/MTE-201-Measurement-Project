# Voltage Divider Microcontroller Code README

---

## Overview

This repository contains code for implementing a voltage divider using a microcontroller. The voltage divider circuit is a fundamental electronic component used to obtain a fraction of an input voltage. This code is written to configure the microcontroller to measure the output voltage of a voltage divider circuit and potentially perform further actions based on the measured voltage.
