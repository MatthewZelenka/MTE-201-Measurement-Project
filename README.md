# MTE 201 Distance Mesurement project
## Overview
This project was designed to create a digital measurement system to measure up to three 2x4 LEGO bricks in length, which is approximately 100mm.

The project involves a combination of 3D models for building the measurement device and electrical components, including a microcontroller, which for this project was an ESP32.

The way the measurement device works is by sliding one prong down the side of a rail which has a resistive strip attached to it. By doing this, the voltage divider circuit changes the voltage the microcontroller reads. This is then calibrated using software on the desktop, reading the serial port to produce a distance measurement.
